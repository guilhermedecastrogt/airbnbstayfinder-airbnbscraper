Their house is in a great walking distance to everything (10 minute walk to Book of Kells/Trinity College, 15 to temple bar and directly by the river). <br/>The room itself was cozy — very small but is exactly what’s listed/described on the website. The only downside is that the walls were very thin so if that bothers you (or you’re a light sleeper) it might not be the place to stay. Because of that I didn’t feel quite as comfortable moving around or coming in and out of the house later at night or in the mornings (just because you can really hear everything so you need to be super quiet). <br/>But it’s a pretty decent spot to stay as a solo traveler if you’re trying to be out and about a lot and need a close walking distance to downtown Dublin!"

Il quartiere è tranquillo, vicino sia alla stazione che al centro città, ma anche alle fermate del bus per l’aeroporto. Dean e Andy sono cordiali e molto reattivi nelle risposte e se sarete fortunati, ad accogliervi ci sarà il loro adorabile cagnolino."

The room is a \"box room\" on the 1st floor facing the back of the house with a single bed and a shelving unit with kettle/toaster. It is plain, clean and it is very much \"what it says on the tin\". <br/>This is a room in an older house, and though the house itself has been nicely done up the room is still slightly barren and overlooks a slightly rougher looking back yard. I had what I needed for my overnight, no major complaints. The mattress was slightly hard (like hard foam?) and there was no blackout curtain. The bathroom was nice and clean. Thank you to Dean for the easy and pleasant check in."

The location is fab, walking distance to so many things like EPIC Museum, some nice pubs, bakeries and more. The room itself was nice and clean, it had all the amenities I needed to feel comfortable during my stay! I've already recommended this space to some friends, and I'd most certainly want to stay here again next time I'm in the city. Thanks for your hospitality Dean, Andy & Chico :)"

Because it was too noisy, I couldn't sleep all night. The curtains are only made of a thin fabric. The TV doesn't work. The refrigerator and the kitchen can only be used by the landlord himself. What's even more terrifying is that a one-centimeter-long bug was found on the bedside table. At the same price, you could stay in a budget hotel. It's much worse than the single room in a youth hostel. Please choose carefully!"

I came during a hot summer day and the windows were a great help. Looks like heating is available. Bed is comfy and shower is spacious. I’d definitely stay again because of the location and hosts were so helpful. Dean saved me €30-40 by letting me use a charger for my phone because I forgot mine! He made me feel as if I could reach out for any request. They have cameras which I appreciate for safety reasons and I had keys to my quarters at all times. This was by far a nicer option than another bnb I stayed by the airport which was in shambles. They kept it up nicely. They were a delight!"

I did not notice it when sleeping but when i sat at the end of the bed on the second morning to put on my socks, the mattress was completed unsupported and I ended up falling backwards onto the floor inside the base. I got up and checked it and only about 70% of the mattress was supported by slats and the slats that were there were only held by basic plastic tie wraps. I had a few bruises but nothing serious luckily.  It could have gotten a bad injury. I reported this to the hosts and they responded with extreme hostility making discriminatory insults, false accusations and demanding the whole bed be replaced (even though only the plastic tie wraps were broken). Do not stay in this place because if there is any small disagreement, you will have to deal with extreme hostility. Airbnb has given them a warning as they violated the terms and conditions of operation (not enough punishment IMO)"

Their house is in a great walking distance to everything (10 minute walk to Book of Kells/Trinity College, 15 to temple bar and directly by the river). <br/>The room itself was cozy — very small but is exactly what’s listed/described on the website. The only downside is that the walls were very thin so if that bothers you (or you’re a light sleeper) it might not be the place to stay. Because of that I didn’t feel quite as comfortable moving around or coming in and out of the house later at night or in the mornings (just because you can really hear everything so you need to be super quiet). <br/>But it’s a pretty decent spot to stay as a solo traveler if you’re trying to be out and about a lot and need a close walking distance to downtown Dublin!"

Il quartiere è tranquillo, vicino sia alla stazione che al centro città, ma anche alle fermate del bus per l’aeroporto. Dean e Andy sono cordiali e molto reattivi nelle risposte e se sarete fortunati, ad accogliervi ci sarà il loro adorabile cagnolino."

The room is a \"box room\" on the 1st floor facing the back of the house with a single bed and a shelving unit with kettle/toaster. It is plain, clean and it is very much \"what it says on the tin\". <br/>This is a room in an older house, and though the house itself has been nicely done up the room is still slightly barren and overlooks a slightly rougher looking back yard. I had what I needed for my overnight, no major complaints. The mattress was slightly hard (like hard foam?) and there was no blackout curtain. The bathroom was nice and clean. Thank you to Dean for the easy and pleasant check in."

The room itself was nice and clean, it had all the amenities I needed to feel comfortable during my stay! I've already recommended this space to some friends, and I'd most certainly want to stay here again next time I'm in the city. Thanks for your hospitality Dean, Andy & Chico :)"

Because it was too noisy, I couldn't sleep all night. The curtains are only made of a thin fabric. The TV doesn't work. The refrigerator and the kitchen can only be used by the landlord himself. What's even more terrifying is that a one-centimeter-long bug was found on the bedside table. At the same price, you could stay in a budget hotel. It's much worse than the single room in a youth hostel. Please choose carefully!"

(The house does accommodate another bnb guest room and you share toilet.) <br/>The single room is clean, great ventilation unlike many other places, no AC like most places in Ireland. I came during a hot summer day and the windows were a great help. Looks like heating is available. Bed is comfy and shower is spacious. I’d definitely stay again because of the location and hosts were so helpful. Dean saved me €30-40 by letting me use a charger for my phone because I forgot mine! He made me feel as if I could reach out for any request. They have cameras which I appreciate for safety reasons and I had keys to my quarters at all times. This was by far a nicer option than another bnb I stayed by the airport which was in shambles. They kept it up nicely. They were a delight!"

Dean’s cute dog was also quiet. Although a little small, the room was cozy and had a window, facing private spaces which was super great. The bathroom was clean and big. Highly recommend!"

        "comments": "They chose the cheapest possible bed with not enough slats to cover the area under the mattress. I did not notice it when sleeping but when i sat at the end of the bed on the second morning to put on my socks, the mattress was completed unsupported and I ended up falling backwards onto the floor inside the base. I got up and checked it and only about 70% of the mattress was supported by slats and the slats that were there were only held by basic plastic tie wraps. I had a few bruises but nothing serious luckily.  It could have gotten a bad injury. I reported this to the hosts and they responded with extreme hostility making discriminatory insults, false accusations and demanding the whole bed be replaced (even though only the plastic tie wraps were broken). Do not stay in this place because if there is any small disagreement, you will have to deal with extreme hostility. Airbnb has given them a warning as they violated the terms and conditions of operation (not enough punishment IMO)"
