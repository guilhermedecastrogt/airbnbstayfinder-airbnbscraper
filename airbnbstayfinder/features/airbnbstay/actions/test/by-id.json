We could check in on the day that we booked and communication was quick, clear and efficient. Ed provided a very clear description of the location, how to get in, pubs/shops/etc around and answered all our questions very quickly. Ed was very kind in his way of communication. The studio looks like the pictures, however it can use a little ''clean up'' cupboard doors in the kitchen broken, dirty kitchen wall, some hole in the wall, some things getting loose etc. It didnt bother us at all, the place is more than fine, its just little things that maybe one day deserve some attention. Its a good place if you have to work, there is dedicated place for that and its comfortable. What was a bit of a challenge at times was the shared bathroom not everyone understood to open the doors after use, and the slamming doors at times could be annoying.
